# **How to Manually Clone, Build, and Link Dependencies from `@diia-inhouse` Scope**

## **Reason**

The scope of `@diia-inhouse/<package>` is private and does not exist in the public npm registry. This means that we cannot install a package from the `@diia-inhouse/<package>` scope by merely running `npm install`. Instead of installation, we have to clone each required package from the git repository, install its dependencies, and create an `npm link`. This will create a link to a local copy of that package, ready to be used as an npm dependency.

## **Nested Dependencies**

Each package from `@diia-inhouse/<package>` scope typically has another package from that scope as a dependency.

This means that before linking packages, we have to define the correct order in which we clone, install, build, and link each package.

To fully understand this issue, let's consider a simple chain of dependencies:

`@diia-inhouse/db` -> `@diia-inhouse/crypto` -> `@diia-inhouse/errors`

According to that chain, the linking order of dependencies is:

1. `@diia-inhouse/errors`
2. `@diia-inhouse/crypto`
3. `@diia-inhouse/db`

When we consider linking a specific package, we must already have linked all packages from its `package.json`.

## **Linking Process**

Let's go ahead and create an npm link for the `@diia-inhouse/errors` package.

### **1. Clone Code from Git Repository**

```bash
$ git clone git@<git-repo-host>:diia-inhouse/pkg-errors.git
```

> **_NOTE:_** Packages that end with *-client are not listed as separate git repositories. You can find them prebuilt in the [clients](clients/) folder.

### **2. Install and Use Linked Packages**

As we can see according to `package.json`, this package only has `devDependencies` to install and use:

```json
"devDependencies": {
    "@diia-inhouse/configs": "1.7.1",
    "@diia-inhouse/eslint-config": "1.12.0",
    "@diia-inhouse/test": "2.3.0",
    "@diia-inhouse/types": "2.17.0"
},
```

```bash
$ cd ./pkg-errors
$ npm link @diia-inhouse/configs @diia-inhouse/eslint-config @diia-inhouse/test @diia-inhouse/types
```

The command above will install and use already linked packages. 

**We assume that the linking process is already complete for each package from the list above.**

### **3. Build `@diia-inhouse/errors`**

```bash
$ npm run build
```

### **4. Create npm link for `@diia-inhouse/errors`**

```bash
$ npm link
```
